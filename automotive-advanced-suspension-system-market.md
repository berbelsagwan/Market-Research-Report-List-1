<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Advanced Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Automotive Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Automotive Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive advanced suspension system market is categorized into two main types: independent and non-independent suspension systems. Independent suspension systems allow each wheel to move independently, providing improved ride quality and handling, commonly used in passenger vehicles. In contrast, non-independent suspension systems utilize a solid axle or beam, where wheel movement affects the opposite wheel. This design is often found in trucks and older vehicles, offering durability and simplicity, but may compromise ride comfort and handling compared to independent systems.</p></p>
