<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc</li><li>Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive braking system market features two primary types: disc and drum brakes. Disc brakes utilize a flat, circular disc and a caliper that clamps down on the disc to create friction, offering superior heat dissipation and quicker stopping power. Drum brakes consist of a cylindrical drum that houses brake shoes, which expand against the drum's inner surface to generate braking force. Disc brakes are commonly found in modern vehicles for their efficiency, while drum brakes are often used in older models and certain utility vehicles.</p></p>
