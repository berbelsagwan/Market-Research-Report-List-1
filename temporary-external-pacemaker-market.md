<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary External Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Dual Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Triple Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The temporary external pacemaker market is categorized into three main types: single chamber, dual chamber, and triple chamber pacemakers. A single chamber pacemaker stimulates one heart chamber, typically the right ventricle, making it suitable for patients with certain arrhythmias. Dual chamber pacemakers regulate both the atrium and ventricle, enhancing coordination between chambers. Triple chamber pacemakers, also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, manage both ventricles and the atrium, targeting advanced heart failure and promoting effective heart function.</p></p>
